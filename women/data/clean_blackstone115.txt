next consider manner marriage may dissolved either death divorce
two kind divorce one total partial one vinculo matrimonii from matrimonial bond merely mensa et thoro from bed board
total divorce vinculo matrimonii must canonical cause impediment beforementioned those existing marriage always case consanguinity supervenient extraneous arising afterwards may case affinity corporal imbecility
case total divorce marriage declared null absolutely unlawful ab initio party therefore separated pro salute animarum reason observed divorce obtained life party
issue marriage thus entirely dissolved bastard
divorce mensa et thoro marriage lawful ab initio therefore law tender dissolving it but supervenient cause becomes improper impossible party live together case intolerable ill temper adultery either party
canon law common law follows case deems highly mysterious reverence nuptial tie allow unloosed cause whatsoever arises union made
said built divine revealed law though expressly assigns incontinence cause indeed cause man may put away wife marry another
civil law partly pagan original allows many cause absolute divorce pretty severe one a wife go theater public game without knowledge consent husband among adultery principal reason named first30 u england adultery cause separation bed board31 best reason given is divorce allowed depend upon matter within power either party would probably extremely frequent case divorce allowed canonical disability mere confession parties32 prohibited canons33 however divorce vinculo matrimonii adultery late year frequently granted act parliament
case divorce mensa et thoro law allows alimony wife allowance made woman support husband’s estate settled discretion ecclesiastical judge consideration circumstance case
sometimes called estovers which refuse payment besides ordinary process excommunication writ common law de estoveriis habendis of recovering estovers order recover
generally proportioned rank quality party
case elopement living adulterer law allows alimony

thus shown marriage may made dissolved come now lastly speak legal consequence making dissolution
marriage husband wife one person law36 is legal existence woman suspended marriage least incorporated consolidated husband whose wing protection cover performs everything therefore called lawfrench femecovert married woman said covertbaron protection influence husband baron lord condition marriage called coverture
upon principle union person husband wife depend almost legal right duty disability either acquire marriage
speak present right property merely personal
reason man cannot grant anything wife enter covenant her grant would suppose separate existence covenant her would covenant himself therefore also generally true compact made husband wife single voided intermarriage
woman indeed may attorney husband implies separation from rather representation of lord
husband may also bequeath anything wife will cannot take effect till coverture determined death
husband bound provide wife necessary law much himself contract debt them obliged pay them anything besides necessary chargeable
also wife elopes life another man husband chargeable even necessary last person furnishes them sufficiently apprized elopement
wife indebted marriage husband bound afterwards pay debt adopted circumstance together
wife injured person property bring action redress without husband’s concurrence name well own neither sued without making husband defendant
indeed one case wife shall sue sued feme sole single woman viz
husband abjured realm banished dead law and husband thus disabled sue defend wife would unreasonable remedy could make defense
criminal prosecution true wife may indicted punished separately union civil union
but trial sort allowed evidence for against other partly impossible testimony indifferent principally union person therefore admitted witness other would contradict one maxim law “nemo propria causa testis esse debet” no one ought witness cause other would contradict another maxim “nemo tenetur seipsum accusare” no one bound accuse himself

case woman forcibly taken away married may witness husband order convict felony
case propriety reckoned wife main ingredient consent wanting contract also another maxim law man shall take advantage wrong ravisher would do forcibly marrying woman could prevent witness perhaps witness fact
civil law husband wife considered two distinct person may separate estate contract debt injury therefore ecclesiastical court woman may sue sued without husband
but though law general considers man wife one person yet instance separately considered inferior him acting compulsion
therefore deed executed act done her coverture void least voidable except fine like matter record case must solely secretly examined learn act voluntary
cannot devise land husband unless special circumstance time making supposed coercion
felony inferior crime committed her constraint husband law excuse her extends treason murder
husband also by old law might give wife moderate correction
for answer misbehavior law thought reasonable entrust power restraining her domestic chastisement moderation man allowed correct servant child master parent also liable case answer
power correction confined within reasonable bounds58 husband prohibited use violence wife aliter quam ad virum ex causa regiminis et castigationis uxoris suae licite et rationabiliter pertinet other lawfully reasonably pertains husband rule correction wife
civil law gave husband same larger authority wife allowing him misdemeanor flagellis et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem to beat wife severely whip stick others modicam castigationem adhibere with moderate punishment60 but u politer reign charles second power correction began doubted61 wife may security peace husband or return husband wife
yet lower rank people always fond old common law still claim exert ancient privilege court law still permit husband restrain wife liberty case gross misbehavior
chief legal effect marriage coverture upon may observe even disability wife lie under part intended protection benefit
